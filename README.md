# Project 5: Neighborhood Map

The neighborhood I chose to implement was inspired by Food Network's <i>Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives</i> and contains an assortment of restaurant locations that were visited by Guy Fieri during the show.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide an example of an application that utlizes a framework to separate concerns when programming.  The modular nature of separating concerns allows for a very succinct implementation of code.  The model, view, and view-models are distinct entities and allow for easy reading and understanding.  Learning a framework with an organized design pattern is crucial to writing manageable code.<br>

Another facet of this project is the implementation of AJAX requests.  This application makes two types of AJAX requests, one to the geocode API from Google, and the FourSquare API.  Being able to interact with API servers and handle the data that is returned is one of the primary functions of a front-end developer.

## The Key Locations "List View"

The key locations list view is automatically populated based on an object containing preset 'Venue Name' and 'Address' key-value pairs.  Clicking on a location in the list view will highlight it with a yellow color.  The corresponding map marker will also be notified of the click.  The key locations can be sorted via the 'Search' input bar.  The hamburger icon toggles the menu on and off screen.

## Search Bar

The search bar actively checks each keypress or text input against the names listed in the 'Key Locations' list view.  Any match in string or sub-string will result in the key location remaining.  Any key location that does not match the search string in any manner will be hidden from view.  The corresponding map markers respond in the same manner as the key locations in the 'list view.'  If a location is hidden from the 'list view' then it will also be hidden on the map.  In this way, the search bar actively sorts both the key locations and map markers in tandem.

## Google Map

The Google map API is used to display a map centered on a default latitude and longitude.  Map markers are generated with only the venue's name and address.  Each name/address pair is sent through Google's geocode API where the latitude and longitude of the location is determined.  A map marker and infoWindow pair are created and then set on the map.  The infoWindow that is intially created contains default information that is displayed.  This default information is overwritten upon the successful callback of the FourSquare API.  The FourSquare AJAX call returns the venue's phone number and website.  This data is then compiled together, and appended to the corresponding infoWindow.  If the FourSquare API fails in any manner, the infoWindow's default content will remain and alert the user to that error. <br>

Clicking on the map marker will open the infoWindow, animate the marker, and highlight the corresponding venue name in the key locations 'list view.'  Clicking again will remove the infoWindow and un-highlight the corresponding venue name.

## App Architecture

This app uses the knockout.js framework.  The list view and search bar are written as separate view-models that are combined into a parent view-model that allows the two to interact with one another.  The map from google acts as its own separate view-model but does not contain any knockoug observables, nor does it require any bindings to run.  The map and view-model for the 'list view' communicate via changes in the individual marker settings.

## Running the Application

You will need an internet connection to successfully run this neighborhood map application.  It relies on the google Maps API to render the map and create the markers.  The FourSquare API is utilized to generate specific information and contact details in the map marker's infoWindows.<br>

A Gruntfile is included along with package.json which lists all the dependencies required to generate a distributable version of the site.  Html, CSS, and javascript are all minified via this process.

To install and run Grunt:

1.	Make sure you have the latest version of node.js (npm comes bundled with newer versions)
2.	Install the Grunt cli by typing in the cmd line in the project directory: 'npm install -g grunt-cli'
3.	Copy over the package.json and gruntfile.js
4.	Install the project dependencies: 'npm install'
5.	Run the Grunt default tasks which are already setup in the gruntfile.js provided
